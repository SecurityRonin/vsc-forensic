# Contributing to vsc-forensic

Thanks for your interest in improving `vsc-forensic`. These crates parse
untrusted Windows Volume Shadow Copy (VSS) structures acquired from potentially
compromised systems, so correctness and robustness are not negotiable. The bar
is high and the workflow is strict — please read this before opening a pull
request.

The repository is currently an early-stage scaffold: the VSS parser is under
construction (see [`docs/RESEARCH.md`](docs/RESEARCH.md) for the format
research that guides the design). The disciplines below apply from the first
line of parser code.

## Test-Driven Development is mandatory

Every code change follows strict Red-Green-Refactor, and the RED and GREEN steps
land as **two separate commits**:

1. **RED** — write the failing test(s) first. They must define the expected
   behaviour and actually fail. Commit them alone. This commit is the verifiable
   proof that the test was written first.
2. **GREEN** — write the minimal implementation that makes the tests pass.
   Commit it separately.
3. **REFACTOR** — clean up while keeping every test green.

A single combined commit is not accepted. There is no "hard to test" exemption:
if something is awkward to unit test, use the closest testable abstraction,
fixtures, or an integration test — but write the test first.

Because you are validating code you wrote with tests you wrote, also validate
against **real external data** where it matters: cross-check parsing against real
VSS volumes and an independent oracle (e.g. `libvshadow`/`vshadowinfo`), not
only synthetic fixtures.

## Quality gates

All of the following must pass locally and in CI before a PR can merge:

```bash
cargo fmt --all -- --check                  # formatting
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings   # lints, warnings denied
cargo deny check                            # license / advisory / source policy
cargo test --workspace                      # unit + integration
cargo llvm-cov --workspace --show-missing-lines   # 100% line coverage
```

- **Formatting** — `cargo fmt`; do not hand-format.
- **Lints** — `cargo clippy` with warnings denied.
- **Dependencies** — `cargo deny` must pass (no copyleft, no flagged advisories).
- **Coverage** — 100% line coverage is enforced; no source line may be left
  uncovered. New code needs tests that exercise its error paths, not just the
  happy path.
- **Fuzzing** — once the parser lands, every parsed structure gets a `cargo-fuzz`
  target whose invariant is "must not panic," plus a CI workflow that smoke-runs
  each target. A parser change must keep its fuzz target green.

## Robustness expectations

- No panics on malicious input — validate every length and offset against both
  the declared size and the actual buffer; use checked or saturating arithmetic.
- Fail loud — surface malformed input as a typed error with enough context to
  diagnose it. Never swallow an error or substitute a silent default.
- Keep `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]` intact.

## Commits and signing

- Keep diffs minimal — change only the lines the task requires; no drive-by
  reformatting of unrelated code.
- Commits are signed with [gitsign](https://github.com/sigstore/gitsign)
  (keyless Sigstore signing). Ensure your commits are signed before pushing.
